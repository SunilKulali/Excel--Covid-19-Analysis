## Project Objectives

- Understand the spread of COVID-19 across various countries.
- Analyze trends in infection rates, mortality rates, and recoveries.
- Visualize the data through charts, graphs, and dashboards for easy interpretation.
- Derive insights from the data to understand key patterns.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: 
   - Import data into Excel from CSV files.
   - Remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies, and handle missing data.
   
2. **Data Transformation**: 
   - Create calculated fields such as Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Recovery Rate, and Percentage of Population Infected.
   
3. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Calculate summary statistics such as total cases, total deaths, and total recoveries.
   - Analyze the trend of cases over time.
   - Compare countries and regions in terms of COVID-19 impact.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - Create pivot tables to segment data by country and region.
   - Use Excel charts (line charts, bar charts, and pie charts) to visualize trends.
   - Build dashboards to present the analysis interactively.

## Key Findings

- The infection rate and mortality rate varied significantly across regions.
- Countries with high vaccination rates saw a noticeable reduction in cases and deaths.
- Recovery rates improved over time as treatments and vaccines became more widely available.

## How to Use

1. Download the Excel file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
3. Navigate through the different sheets to explore raw data, pivot tables, and visualizations.
4. Modify the filters on the dashboards to focus on specific countries or time periods.

## Future Work

- Automate the data refresh process using Power Query in Excel.
- Add more data points like vaccination rates, variants of concern, and hospitalizations.
- Compare the impact of different lockdown policies across countries.
